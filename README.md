# Intro

The CCTV_AI system is designed to detect the presence of individuals and alert users through a mobile app and CCTV camera setup. The purpose of this project is to prevent theft and trespassing by taking real-time action to mitigate any potential losses.

From a technical standpoint, the system utilizes TensorFlow, Kivy, Firebase, Python, object detection, deep learning, and Firebase Storage Bucket. TensorFlow is used for implementing the object detection model, Kivy for creating the mobile app interface, Firebase for storing and retrieving data, and Python as the programming language for development.

The combination of these technologies allows the system to analyze CCTV footage, identify individuals, and send alerts to users when any suspicious activity is detected. The use of deep learning and object detection algorithms ensures accurate detection and reduces false positives.

Additionally, the integration with Firebase Storage Bucket enables the system to securely store and retrieve data, such as captured images or video footage, for further analysis or evidence purposes.

Overall, the CCTV_AI system aims to provide an effective and reliable solution for enhancing security measures and preventing potential threats through advanced technology and real-time alerts.
